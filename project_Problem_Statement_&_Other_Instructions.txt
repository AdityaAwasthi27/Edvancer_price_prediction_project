Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression

OBJECTIVE
This Machine Learing Project involves Building a Predictive model using Linear Regression and predicting the accurate prices of the Real Estate proterties.

Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

TAGS
Linear Regression, RMSE.

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project involves the following steps:

1. Imputing NA values in the datasets.
2. Data Preparation:Grouping similar category variables and making dummies.
3. Model Building. ( LINEAR REGRESSION )
4 .Perfomance measurement of the model. (Calculating RMSE)
5. Predicting Real Estate Prices for the final Test Dataset.

DATA DICTIONARY
There exist two datasets, housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv .
We will use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable “Price”.
Housing_test data contains all other factors except “Price” which we can use for testing purpose.
The evalution metric will be RMSE.
